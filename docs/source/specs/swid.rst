Software Identification (SWID)
******************************


`Software Identification (SWID) Tags <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID>`_ are defined by the `ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 <https://www.iso.org/standard/65666.html>`_ standard. They provide a transparent way for organizations to track installed software on managed devices. The SWID Tags contain information for specific releases of a software product. 

The SWID standard defines a lifecycle where a SWID Tag is added to an endpoint as part of the software product’s installation process and deleted by the product’s uninstall process.

For full detail, please see `Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8060.pdf>`_.
