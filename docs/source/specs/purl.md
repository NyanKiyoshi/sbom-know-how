   # Package URL
   
   [PURL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) is a mini spec used in [CycloneDX](cyclonedx.md), [SPDX](spdx.md) and [CSAF](https://oasis-open.github.io/csaf-documentation/faq.html) [VEX](vex.md).

   It is is a standardization attempt to reliably identify and locate software packages with the existing approaches. A purl is a URL string used to identify and locate a software package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programing languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.

   ## Companion open source vulnerability databases

   * [VulnerableCode](https://github.com/nexb/vulnerablecode) available at https://public.vulnerablecode.io is keyed by purl. It is an open source code and open data correlated and aggregated vulnerability database.
   * [purldb](https://github.com/nexB/purldb/) is a companion database of all the purls listed in the repo.
