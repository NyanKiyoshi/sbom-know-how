## CycloneDX Parsers

CycloneDX parsers can be found in the [CycloneDX Tool Center](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/)'s Library section.

## SPDX Parsers

SPDX has the following language-specific tools:
* [SPDX Online Tool](https://tools.spdx.org/app/validate/) for SBOM validation
* [tools-golang](https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang)
* [tools-java](https://github.com/spdx/tools-java)
* [spdx-tools-js](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-tools-js)
* [tools-python](https://github.com/spdx/tools-python)
* [spdx-tools in pypi](https://pypi.org/project/spdx-tools/)

## Conversion tools

* [cdx2spdx](https://github.com/spdx/cdx2spdx) converts CycloneDX SBOMs to SPDX. The conversion is done based on the [SPDX-CycloneDX Mapping](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PIiSYLJHlt8djG5OoOYniy_I-J31UMhBKQ62UUBHKVA/edit#gid=862310124).
