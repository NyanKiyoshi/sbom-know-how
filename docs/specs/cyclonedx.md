# CycloneDX

The CycloneDX specification is initiated by [OWASP](https://owasp.org) and is focused on creating security context. It allows identifying known vulnerabilities in components using [CPE](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe), [SWID](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/swid), and [PURL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) fields.

For more detail, please see the [OWASP Vulnerability Naming Schemes](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/5-Reporting/02-Naming_Schemes) and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) official documentation.
